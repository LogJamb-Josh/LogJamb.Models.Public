# LogJamb.Models.Public
This repository is intended to establish a standard that digitally defines a physical jamb, and its relevant obstructions, to a sufficient degree that jamb related products, such as doors and windows, can be selected or engineered for use with the jamb.  This standard will primarily focus on defining an over-the-wire model in which disjunct APIs can standardize communication, but will also provide a database schema in which the Jamb can be stored.
